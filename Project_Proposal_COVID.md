## Project Proposal

Our project is to determine if there is a correlation between a country's GDP and the amount of testing that is done.  

We will analyze datasets from 

[Our World in DataOur World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing)
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Testing - Statistics and Research

[owid/covid-19-data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)
Data on COVID-19 (coronavirus) cases, deaths, hospitalizations, tests â€¢ All countries. Updated daily by [Our World in Data Website](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus)

[World Bank Data Bank](https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicatorsowid/covid-19-data)
The primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially-recognized international sources. 

---

The questions we will be asking the data are:

* How many tests are done each day? (by continent, country, city)

* Are the number of test performed representative of the population? (Have to be more than 30% to be representative)

* How many tests are done by city or country, before one positive COVID case is found?

* How many COVID test have been performed at to a given date  and how many were positive ?

* Is there a correlation between a country's GDP per capita and:
	- The number of COVID testing that is performed?
	- The number of deaths. 
	- The positivity rate.
