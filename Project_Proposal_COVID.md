## Project Proposal

Our project is to determine if there is a correlation between the number of total active COVID-19 cases reported at a date and the amount of testing that is done. 

We will analyze two datasets from [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/josephassaker/covid-19-global-data-analysis-visualization), one with daily new case data and a summary data set with total testing numbers, by countries. 

The questions we will be asking the data are:

* What are the cummulative number of tests per continent and how that compares to
the active cases data.  Is there a relation between them?

* What are the best type of charts for the number of cases?  For the number of tests?  For the correlation analysis?
