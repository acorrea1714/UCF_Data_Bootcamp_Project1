## Project Proposal

Our project is an analysis to identify key factors that contribute to income distribution among races in the United States, by analyzing data from 2010 to 2019, inclusive. 

Null Hypothesis : Median income in the United States between 2010 and 2019 is equal between the different races. 
Alternate Hypothesis: Median income in the United States between 2010 and 2019 is not equal between the races. 

We will analyze datasets from [United States Census ](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-finc.html) Current Population Survey Tables for Family Income. 

---

The questions we will be asking the data are:

* Is race diversity a statically significant factor in determining the median income in the United States? 
* Are there other factors to consider that can affect income distribution among races?
