## Project Proposal

Our project is to establish if there is a correlation between having 3 or more risk factors and the final occurrence of heart failure.


We will analyze a dataset from [kaggle.com]
https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data that shows the occurrence of heart failure for 300 patients of different age groups, and the existence of 
several risk factors. 

The questions we will be asking the data are:

* What are the correlations between heart failure cases and each individual risk factor?
* What are the strongest correlations?
* Is there a higher risk of heart failure if a patient has three or more risk factors?
* Are smokers more at risk vs those with diabetes for heart failure?
* Are males vs females more at risk for heart failure?
