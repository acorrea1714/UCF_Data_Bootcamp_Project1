# Proposal For Project 1 - Predicting Heart Failure 
There are many risk factors associated with heart failure. In this project, we attempt to find if there is a strong correlation between several individual risk factor and the final occurence of heart failure.

## Project Proposal

Our project is to establish if there is a correlation between having 3 or more risk factors and the final occurrence of heart failure.


We will analyze a dataset from [kaggle.com]
https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data that shows the occurrence of heart failure for 300 patients of different age groups, and the existence of 
several risk factors. 

The questions we will be asking the data are:

* Is there a correlation of each individual risk factor and death by heart failure? 
* If there is a correlation, how strong is it?
* Is there a higher risk of heart failure if a patient has three or more risk factors?
* Are smokers more at risk vs those with diabetes for heart failure?
* Are males vs females more at risk for heart failure?
